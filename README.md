# Random-Scripts
My scripts and modifications to other people's scripts to suit my needs

### Invoke-Persistence.ps1
This is a modified version of Invoke-ADSBackdoor persistence script by @enigma0x3. I basically just added WMI persistence capability and the modified it to take a payload as URL. I also modified Nikhil Mittal Remove-Persistence module from Nishang to be able to remove the WMI Persistence module. It basically takes in a URL payload generated by metasploit or cobalt strike stored on your webserver. It used two methods to achieve persistence. If its run with admin privileges it leverages WMI persistence, if run without it creates a payload by using two Alternate Data Streams and creates are key in the registry HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run (lame I know) so its executed on startup. The first Alternate Data stream stores the payload and the second Alternate Data Stream stores some VBScript that acts as a wrapper in order to hide the DOS prompt when invoking the data stream containing the payload.

### Why?
For some reason Im unable to use the Persistence module from PowerSploit without breaking the Powershell of the Victim computer. Nishang's Add-Persistence non admin technique doesnt leverage ADS. Enigma0x3's script doesnt have a WMI Persistence function.

### mod_unicorn.py
This is a fork from TrustedSec's Dave Kennedy powershell payload generator. Sometimes you just want a properly obfuscated unicorned payload without any spaces or fancy character joining to paste into your script. 

### USAGE
```
root@kali:~/unicorn# python mod_unicorn.py
